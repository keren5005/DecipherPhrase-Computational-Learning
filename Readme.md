Sure, I can help you create a README file for your project. The README file is essential for providing information about your project, its purpose, how to set it up, and any other relevant details. Here's a basic template you can use:

DecipherPhrase-Computational-Learning
Overview
This Python program is designed to decipher a phrase using a provided lexicon and alphabet. It utilizes computational learning to find the optimal decryption key (K) for the given encrypted phrase.

Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/keren5005/DecipherPhrase-Computational-Learning.git
cd DecipherPhrase-Computational-Learning
Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python installed. You may need to install the required packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy
Run the Program:

bash
Copy code
python decipher.py
Configuration:
Modify the config-decipher.json file to set the secret phrase, lexicon filename, and ABC filename.

Files
decipher.py:
The main Python script for deciphering the given phrase.

config-decipher.json:
Configuration file containing details such as the secret phrase, lexicon filename, and ABC filename.

abc.txt:
File containing the alphabet used for decryption.

lexicon.txt:
File containing the lexicon used for deciphering.

Results
The program will output the deciphered phrase and the optimal decryption key (K).
