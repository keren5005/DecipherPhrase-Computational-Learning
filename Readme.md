## DecipherPhrase-Computational-Learning

## Overview

Welcome to the DecipherPhrase-Computational-Learning project! This Python program is designed to intelligently decipher a given phrase using a provided lexicon and alphabet. Leveraging computational learning techniques, the script aims to find the optimal decryption key (K) for the encrypted phrase.

# Project Structure
decipher.py:
The core Python script responsible for deciphering the provided phrase.

config-decipher.json:
Configuration file containing essential details such as the secret phrase, lexicon filename, and ABC filename.

abc.txt:
File containing the alphabet used for decryption.

lexicon.txt:
File containing the lexicon used for deciphering.

Results
Upon execution, the program will output the deciphered phrase along with the optimal decryption key (K).
